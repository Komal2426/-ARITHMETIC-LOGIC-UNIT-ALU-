The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is one of the most important components of a digital system or processor. It performs arithmetic and logical operations on binary data as required by the CPU. The ALU serves as the core part of the execution unit where all computations are carried out.In this project, an 8-bit ALU was designed and simulated using Cadence tool. The design supports multiple operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT based on the control selection inputs. The Cadence Virtuoso/SimVision environment was used for RTL-level simulation and verification of the design functionality. The simulation verified that the ALU produces correct output for all operation modes.
